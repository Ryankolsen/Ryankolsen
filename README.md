- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ryankolsen
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding, audible books, and my family
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... WILCO!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... all React things! I absolutely love the front end or anything with Javascript/Typescript. Lately I have really been enjoying NextJS, tRPC, and the create-t3-app. I try to be a good person and love the computer science field.
